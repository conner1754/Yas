        <h1>It's Raining Ball Sacks</h1>
        <p>Goddamn it's raining ball sacks</p>
        <p>So there was this one time I was at my house and I was like<br /> what if I was dragon<br /></p>
        <p>So I looked at my friend and I was like<br /> "what if I was a dragon?"<br /></p>
        <div id="dragon">
          <h2><em>If</em> I was a <strong>Dragon</strong></h2>
          <p>So now you may be asking yourself...<br><em>what</em> if I was a <strong>dragon</strong>???
          <br>But like... not if you were a dragon.
          <br>Ok so if <em>you</em> were like "What if <em>he</em> was a dragon?"
          <br>So ima tell ya
          <br>So like.. shut up</p>
        </div>
        <div id="contents">

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#do">Stuff I would do</a></li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="do">
            <h2>Stuff I would do</h2>
              <p>haha. oh yea im doin this thing. <br>
              <strong><em>So</em></strong>... If i was a dragon we all know I would probably
              do some different stuff than I do now. I mean not like wierd stuff.
              Like that would be ok though. I don't know doesn't really matter. But I would do this stuff if was 
              A <strong>dragon</strong>. Without further to do. This is the stuff I would do.</p>
              <h3>fly a <img src="./kite.jpg" width="50"> kite</h3>
                <p>I've always wanted to fly a kite. Doesn't matter what color. I would totally do it
                and you wouldn't be able to stop me. Don't even try. I'll bash your teeth in with a hammer.
                </p>
              <h3>Write a Letter <img src="./letter.jpeg" width="50"> to the President</h3>
                <p>I'd write a super awesome letter to the <em>president</em>. He would think it was
                pretty sweet. Even if it hadbad spelling errors and sentences I would like it cause it was mine. And who 
                cares if you don't like it? You can<br> get outta town buster.<img src="kcikbutt.png" width="50">
